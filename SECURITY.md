# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I am dedicated to ensure the security of go-dbase. To achieve this, I follow the Semantic Versioning (semver) scheme, where revisions are in the format "major.minor.patch".
I will release patches for any security vulnerabilities that are discovered in the latest major or minor release. 

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |
