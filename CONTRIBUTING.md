## Embracing GitHub for Development

GitHub is our platform of choice for hosting code, tracking issues and feature requests, and accepting pull requests.
We follow the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/de/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) for code changes.
Pull requests serve as the vehicle for proposing modifications to the codebase.
We enthusiastically welcome your pull requests using the following steps:

- Fork the repository and create a new branch based on main.
- If your changes involve new code, incorporate corresponding tests.
- When altering APIs, remember to update the accompanying documentation.
- Validate that the test suite passes successfully.
- Ensure your code aligns with our coding standards.
- Now you can submit your pull request!

## Reporting Issues via GitHub's Issues Section

We utilize GitHub's issues section to track public bugs.
Creating a bug report is as easy as opening a new issue using our templates.

## Your Contributions Under the BSD 3-Clause License

By submitting your code changes, you implicitly agree to License your contributions under the same BSD 3-Clause license that governs the project.
If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to the maintainers.
